  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <p>We wanted to take a moment regarding the 2020-21 hunting season. Since the end of 2017, we have endeavored to work with the CPW in building a solution for the Reissue Process. While we have always been received by CPW employees with excited
    endorsement, the reality is the contract the CPW has with their IPAWS provider, Aspira, prevents us from working together. Consumers could wait for that relationship to develop a solution, but the CPW survey regarding the reissue process in early
    2020 and subsequent Commission discussion, suggests that will never happen. For reference go to cpw.state.co.us/Documents/Commission/2020/July/Item.18-License.Reissue.Recs.pdf for staff recommendations and survey results. Go to
    cpw.state.co.us/aboutus/Pages/CommissionMeeting2020-7.aspx and watch the YouTube Day 1 video starting at 3:49:30 to watch the Commission issue discussion. Our Public Comments start at 4:10:00.

  <p>In response to the number of reissued licenses question at 4:02:30. The 234 manually reissued licenses per year figure represents licenses that take residents 5 or more preference points. They are sold to one of the next 5 applicants from the
    regular draw order via a CPW phone call pursuant to Colorado Wildlife Regulation Chapter 16, Article​​ IV, #1670. The 20,000 notifications we send per week regarding up to 250 hunt codes with varying license quotas suggests the number of licenses
    sold randomly via the Leftover List is significantly higher. We have made multiple CORA requests with the CPW over the years and have been told no database exists regarding the number of licenses sold via the Leftover List through the Reissue
    process.

  <p>The problem we see with the current process is that the first come first serve customer experience is akin to having fajita scraps randomly tossed in a kiddie pool filled with thousands of piranhas. Unfortunately, the odds of procuring a license
    through this process is abysmal. Even with the aid of this app we beg you not to play this game with the expectations of purchasing a license. Notifications are exhilarating, but the customer experience of going through the CPW login and purchase
    process only to be one of the 99.99% with no quota is miserable. Long story short, we’ve never liked this process and would propose a completely Automated Mobile Solution to the CPW given the chance.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have had communication with former CPW Commission leaders indicating the desire for integration and that the Automated Mobile Solution we would propose is a perfect fit. But the contract with Aspira is a major dilemma for the Leadership Team
    in forming a working relationship with us. From a business perspective, we have heard rumors of a preview list pushed by the Aspira team since the spring of 2019 that would fundamentally change the way we provide information to our subscribers if
    everyone knew which codes are becoming available that week. These rumors hold up our yearly development.
  </p>


  <p>
    There is support within the CPW for an Automated Mobile Solution. However, along with the reasons stated in our Public Comments to the Commission regarding the 2020 survey, the Commission is hesitant to make changes only hearing from desk jockeys
    that can monitor the Leftover List while at work. If YOU are tired of this game and would like to make your voice heard, email these people:

      Let them know that you’d like to see an end to this madness with an Automated Mobile Solution.
For operational purposes we will continue to provide the information while adapting to CPW regulation changes. We will no longer be taking emails. We monitor the 1 in 1000 app crashes throughout the day to fix as needed. Most problems are standard mobile technology freezes that can be user fixed by forcing the app to close and reopening. Always keep the app open in the background to keep the communication portal open for us. This does not use your data except when we send you notifications.
We wish we could tell you a “trick”, but there aren’t any. Email the list.
